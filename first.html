    <H2>Web Technology</H2>

        Web technology refers to the tools, frameworks, and programming languages used to develop and manage websites and web applications.
        It includes front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which define the structure, style, and behavior of web pages.
         Back-end technologies, such as Node.js, PHP, Python, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB, handle server-side operations, data processing, and storage. 
        Web development also involves frameworks and libraries like React.js, Angular, and Express.js, which simplify coding and enhance functionality.
         Additionally, web technologies support protocols like HTTP/HTTPS, APIs, and cloud computing to enable secure communication and scalability.
         With continuous advancements, web technology plays a crucial role in shaping the digital world, making online experiences more interactive and efficient.
